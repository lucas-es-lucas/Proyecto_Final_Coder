'Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you’ll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it’s only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought cause it’s only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within
Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

Plug into me I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I’ll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Accelerate, Utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan
Reinvent the earth inhabitant

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown 
Spit out the bone

The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine

Stop breathing
And dedicate to me
Stop dreaming
And terminate for me
All meaning
You dedicate to me
All feelings
You terminate for me

Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah';

// "By the last breath the fourth winds blow
// Better raise your ears
// The sound of hooves knock at your door
// Lock up your wife and children now
// It's time to wield the blade
// For now you've got some company

// 	The Horsemen are drawing nearer
// 	On leather steeds they ride
// 	They've come to take your life
// 	On through the dead of night
// 	With the Four Horsemen ride
// 	Or choose your fate and die

// You have been dying since the day you were born
// You know it's all been planned
// The quartet of deliverance rides
// A sinner once, a sinner twice
// No need for confessions now
// 'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

// 	The Horsemen are drawing nearer
// 	On leather steeds they ride
// 	They've come to take your life
// 	On through the dead of night
// 	With the Four Horsemen ride
// 	Or choose your fate and die

// Time 
// Has taken its toll on you
// The lines that crack your face
// Famine
// Your body it has torn through
// Withered in every place
// Pestilence
// For what you've had to endure
// And what you have put others through
// Death
// Deliverance for you for sure
// Now there's nothing you can do

// So gather 'round young warriors now
// And saddle up your steeds
// Killing scores with demon swords
// Now is the death of doers of wrong
// Swing the judgement hammer down
// Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

// 	The Horsemen are drawing nearer
// 	On leather steeds they ride
// 	They've come to take your life
// 	On through the dead of night
// 	With the Four Horsemen ride
// 	Or choose your fate and die";
