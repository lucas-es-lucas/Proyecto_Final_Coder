No life 'til leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming 
It's right, well alright
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again

     Hit the lights
     Hit the lights
     Hit the lights

We know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again

     Hit the lights
     Hit the lights
     Hit the lights

With all out screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It's causing you sweet pain, oh sweet pain
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again

     Hit the lights
     Hit the lights
     Hit the lights

By the last breath the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Time 
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you've had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So gather 'round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I'm taking down, you know, whatever's in my way
Getting your kicks as you're shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, same song and dance

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
To join our sinful kind
There's a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now, my child, not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I'm stalking you as prey
Living your life as me, I am you, you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down, grab my hand, walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage 
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness 
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on stage the Marshall noise 
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
'Cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we'll never stop
We'll never quit
'Cause we're Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
Fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we've done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack

Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose

Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse

With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here

The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near

No remorse

Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers

Twisting and turning

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Fight fire with fire

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me

Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you god to say,
"I'll take your life from you?"

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end

Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me
Oh please, god help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see

How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill. Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye

I don't know how to live through this Hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice

Scream, from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forevermore

No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life's for my own, to live my own way

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now
Let my people go, land of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression 
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression 
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression 
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries

Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Barking of machinegun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away

Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front
You coward
You servant
You blind man

Back to the front

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution 
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks, Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, Rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution 
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution 
And you'll get the better seat

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from

Damage, Incorporated

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blackened

Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies

Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life

Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste

See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened

Blackened

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe
I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

     Justice is lost
     Justice is raped
     Justice is gone
     Pulling your strings
     Justice is done
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
     So true
     So real

Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe
I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

     Justice is lost
     Justice is raped
     Justice is gone
     Pulling your strings
     Justice is done
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
     So true
     So real

Lady Justice has been raped 
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe
I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

     Justice is lost
     Justice is raped
     Justice is gone
     Pulling your strings
     Justice is done
     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
     So true
     So real

     Seeking no truth
     Winning is all
     Find it so grim
     So true
     So real

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Your honesty to blame

Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye's disgrace

Unending paper chase
Unending

Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw

Downed by law

Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw

Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through

A megalomania

Reveal

Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be

Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing

Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending

Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
The shortest straw has been pulled for you

Been cheated of my youth

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger
Misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies

Infanticide

Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit: light
Enter: night
Grain of sand
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who cares

They
They betray
I'm your only true friend now

They
They'll betray
I'm forever there

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

You
You're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter

You
You're my mask
You're the one who's blamed

Do
Do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat

Do
Do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true

Hate
I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love

Pay
Pay the price
Pay, for nothing's fair

Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there

Hey
I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true

I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reason, alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you
Sad but true

No more!
The crap rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me, take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee Unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is

Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee Unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee Unforgiven

...And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

...And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere

Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

...And the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

...And my ties are severed clean
The less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere

Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere

Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam

Wherever I may roam

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail

Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

Don't tread on me

Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lighting strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me

All that is, was and will be
Universe much too big to see

Time and space never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitations of human understanding

Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever

Twisting
Turning
Through the never

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Came to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever

Twisting
Turning
Through the never

On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then never comes

All that is, ever
Ever was
Will be ever

Who we are
Ask forever

Twisting
Turning
Through the never
Never

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know 
And I know

So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come

I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come

We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift
Nose to the wind
Shape shift
Feeling I've been
Move swift
All senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill in the air, cold as steel tonight

We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift
Nose to the wind
Shape shift
Feeling I've been
Move swift
All senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day
Hair stands on the back of my neck
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift
Nose to the wind
Shape shift
Feeling I've been
Move swift
All senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of life

Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know

Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know

Deceit

You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard

You
You're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders

Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend, before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see

You
You'll take it on all yourself
Remember, misery loves company

Misery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders

Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery

You just stood there screaming

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
So many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within
It suits you fine
Struggle within
Your ruin
Struggle within
You seal your own coffin
Struggle within
The struggling within

Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal

Struggle within
It suits you fine
Struggle within
Your ruin
Struggle within
You seal your own coffin
Struggle within
The struggling within

Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind

Struggle within
It suits you fine
Struggle within
Your ruin
Struggle within
You seal your own coffin

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
It ain't my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Can't fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
While you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

No way but down
Why you're around
No fooling

It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
You ain't mine

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away

Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps

I don't want it

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me... till clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps

Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown,
King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?


Nothing

You're just nothing
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
You're just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to never-never land

Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

He thinks the answer's cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine

He's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
"I do believe"

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
"I do believe"
"I do believe"

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done
The brightest flame burns quickest
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

When I'm branded, this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced, 
     or straight ahead and know that you must blame?

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, 
     one and the same are we

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I do your time, I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, 
     one and the same are we

I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within

Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red... red, I'm afraid... 
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away"

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

I heard it
He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallows calls, son," I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
And they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away"

He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
I heard it
He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my way"
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face"
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you

The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red

One hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em, man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome

Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, head on, headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Lives way too fast

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

White-knuckle tight

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere cheers of honor

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back

And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Dance, little tin goddess

Drift away
Fade away
Little tin goddess

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black
But the memory remains

To this faded prima donna

Dance, little tin goddess, dance

I feel you too
Feel those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's wanting through
Deep inside you know the seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite to take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
Come dance

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now but it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked skies
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through

No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

Come beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven, too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven, too

Bury the need for it, bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

Forever on and on

You can't take it down

No, you can't bring me down 'cause I'm

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Watch the puppets dancing
See the clowns fall down
Tie your tap shoes tightly
And wear them into town

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here, no, no more

Play the game so nicely
Check, it's your move now
We're standing in this jungle
With serpents I have found

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them

Hit dirt
Shake tree
Split sky
Part sea

Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule

Live, win
Dare, fail
Eat the dirt
And bite the nail

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby

Draw lead
Piss wine
Sink teeth
All mine

Stoke fire
Break neck
Suffer through this
Cheat on death

Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day

Bite the nail

Tell all, spill gut
Off the veil, stand revealed
Show the cards, bring it on, break the seal

Ladies and gentlemen, step right up
And see the man who told the truth

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking on
the bad seed
On the bad seed
Choking

Let on, load off
Confess, cast off
At the mercy, the cat is out
Drop the disguise, spit it up, spit it out

And now, what you've all been waiting for
I give you "He Who Suffers the Truth"

Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need

Choking on the bad seed

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world

Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you're here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach)
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air)
Toy horses start the charge
(All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes)
Robot chessmen standing guard
(Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender)

All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one

Off to war
Off to war

There's a black cloud overhead
That's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth, I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Mom! Look, it's me

And he wants to be called "Father" now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me
Spell only me
I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

Look up to me,
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, it's me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look, it's me, what no one wants to see

Now see the black cloud up ahead
That's me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain

I fall 'cause I've let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And you won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

And I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

Suppose I say "I'm never satisfied"
Suppose I say "You cut some root to make the tree survive"

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?

Suppose I say "The vultures smile at me"
Suppose I say "I've sent them down and they plan to pick you clean"

And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Gone again

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Mirror, mirror, upon thy wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three Xs for the stone
To break this curse a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith, which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me

Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm and karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?

To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

An endless stream of fear that I've made

This frantic tick tick talk of hurry

Saint Anger 'round my neck
He never gets respect
Saint Anger 'round my neck

You flush it out, you flush it out
Saint Anger 'round my neck
You flush it out, you flush it out
He never gets respect

Fuck it all and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself
To let myself go free
Fuck it all and fuckin' no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Medallion noose, I hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake
Like an earth quake
It's hard to see clear
Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you

And I want my anger to be healthy
And I want my anger just for me
And I need my anger not to control
And I want my anger to be me

And I need to set my anger free

These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more

These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's no so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the God that ain't so pure
This is the God that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
The monster lives

This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

We the people
Are we the people?

Some kind of monster
The monster lives

This is the cloud that swallows trust
This is the black that uncolors us
This is the face that you hide from
This is the mask that comes undone

Ominous
I'm in us

It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean baby

Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner, too

Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside, but I'll show you...

I'm OK, just go away
Into the distance let me fade
I'm OK, just go away
I'm OK, but please don't stray too far

Open up your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm being right here, right now
Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm being right here, right now

Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Ooh, can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and 'round in himself

Trying to make me someone else instead

It's my world now

Mama, why's it rainin' in my room?
Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

You can't have it
It's my world, it's my world

Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devils in angels way

It's my time now

Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world
You can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

I'm out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

I don't even know what the question is

God it feels like it only rains on me

Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

Get 'em out of my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Right here I'll stay

Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fades

Shoot me again
I ain't dead yet

Shoot me again

All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
          
All the shots

What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you

Right here I'll stay, with a bullet in my back

Shoot me
Take a shot

I'll stand on my own, with a bullet in my back
I'm stranded and sold, with a bullet in my back

I bite my tongue
Trying not to shoot back
No compromise
My heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant
Wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog
No, let him sleep

Wash your back so you won't stab mine
Get in bed with your own kind
Live your life so you don't see mine
Drape your back so you won't shine

Ooh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile

Using what I want
To get what you want

Ooh Sweet Amber
How sweet are you?
How sweet does it get?

Chase the rabbit, fetch the stick
She rolls me over 'till I'm sick
She deals in habits, deals in pain
I run away, but I'm back again

Ooh then she holds my hand
And I lie to get a smile
And she squeezes tighter
I still lie to get a smile

She holds the pen that spells the end
She traces me and draws me in

Been here before

Been here before couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart and hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away

Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I

Pure if I... Won't you help me?
Purify you and I
Purify you and I
Pure if I... Can't you help me?
Pure if I... Won't you help me?
You and I purify

Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash
Ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes
Diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine

I can find the dirt on anything
I can find the dirt on anything

I ain't dancing with your skeletons
I ain't dancing with what might have been

All within my hands
Squeeze it in, crush it down
All within my hands
Hold it dear, hold it suffocate

All within my hands
Love to death, smack you 'round & 'round and
All within my hands
Beware

Love is control
I'll die if I let go

Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands

All within my hands
Take your fear, pump me up
All within my hands
Let you run, then I pull your leash

All within my hands
Under thumb, under to myself
All within my hands
Beware

Love is control
I'll die if I let go

Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again

I'll die if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I'll fall if I let go
Control is love, love is control

I will only let you breathe
My air that you receive
Then we'll see if I let you love me

Like a siren in my head that always
Threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat 
Like a face 
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused 
Though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that 
I must awaken from each day
Like conviction 
A premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny...... I deny

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by 
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long 
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when 
I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to die

Like a release from prison 
That I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed 
To leave
From way back then
Like a general 
Without a mission 
Until the war will start again...... start again

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by 
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long 
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight 
Curse the day is long 
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life
That was just your life

Need... more and more
Tainted misery 
Bleed... battle scars
Chemical affinity
Reign... legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain... rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke... asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch... kill the light
Incinerate celebrity
Reaper... butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline... redefine
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Nevermind...
You've reached the end of the line

Time... Choke the clock
Steal another day
Die... Faithfully
Narcissistic fade away
Twisted... Jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker... Chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Nevermind...
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today 
We bid farewell... 
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Nevermind...
Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today 
Say goodbye 
Cause you've reached the end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line

Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes
No, the son shine never comes

Push you cross that line,
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes

Love... is a four letter word,
And never spoken here
Love... is a four letter word,
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer,
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear 
The son will shine
This, I swear,
This, I swear,
This, I swear!

Luck. Runs. Out.

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction feel it burn

Still life... incarnation
Still life... infamy

Hallucination 
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we...
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in, 
But your luck runs out

Luck. Runs. Out.

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life... immolation
Still life... infamy

Hallucination 
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we...
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Then you crawl back in,
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck. Runs. Out.

You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
Your luck runs out

Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Death, won't you let me stay?

Empty they say,
Death, hear me call your name,
Call your name...

...suicide 
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forever more

Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty they say,
Death, won't you let me stay?

Empty they say,
Death, hear me call your name, 
Call your name...

...suicide 
I've already died
You're just the funeral
I've been waiting for

...cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forever more

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down 
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, peace at last!

Empty they say,
Death, won't you let me stay?

Empty they say,
Death, hear me call your name, 
Call your name...

...suicide 
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forever more

Forever more,
Forever more
It's just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid,
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?  In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
Thick and suffocating
His sinking life, outside its hell
Inside, intoxicating

He's run aground Like his life, 
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship, 
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?  In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea, but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?  In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?

When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting on the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist
Cannot resist,
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate 
Patronize and complicate

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist
Cannot resist,
The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seed of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all...
Inside you all

So, bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist
Cannot resist,
The Judas kiss

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: annihilation
Desolate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, bones they all rattle 
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse

Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All Eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, reign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardize and ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world, and blame your maker
Wish ‘em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on me, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

When darkness falls
May it be
That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we’re seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we’re dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we’re dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It’s all we’ve ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending 
Return to ash

Now that we’re dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we’re dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we’re dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we’re dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won’t do that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
Fame

Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can’t look away
You turn to stone

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

Obey
Come won’t you stay
Sincere
Sincere
All ends in tears
Endure
Endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede 
Concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won’t go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure
Allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide
Abide
Secrets inside
Deprive
Deprive
To feel so alive
Obey
Obey
Just don’t turn away

Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won’t go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep 
Can’t slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Come won’t you stay

Hello darkness
Say goodbye
Hello darkness
Say goodbye
Hello darkness
Say goodbye

Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don’t fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Father please come home
Shell shocked all I’ve known
Father please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My Life…
The war that never ends

Awaiting for Adams return
Madness,
Smiling as we watch it burn

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Garden,

Greedy,
Needy, must we have more

Hostage to my mind

Fascinate
Partner of insanity
Decimate
Lessons we never learn

Dominate
Killing of the innocence
Deviate
And to dust you return
Yeah

Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Seized by the day
All the dark days of your life

Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Led so astray
All the dark days of your life

Zero,
Reset, creation of man
Foolish,
Ready, to witness again?

Little grave I’m grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I’m dreaming, I will end you

I’ve been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger’s flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here
I’m hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can’t undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it’s my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I’m behind you

Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it’s come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can’t undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, just set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it’s my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can’t undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth 
A life for a life, it’s my burden of proof

You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Ooooh,
No matter where you dwell
You,
Here again, a captive of the howl
You, 
Welcome back to hell

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize you anymore

Ooooh,
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooooh,
Foul tongue, black breath
Change,
Snap inside, the Beast about complete
Change,
Soon infects the rest

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize you anymore
Anymore


Ooooh,
Inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooooh,
The next heir of anarchy
Feel,
Stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel,
The ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?

One crown
Shines on through the sound
One crown
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
One man
No excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces 
Aces ‘til you die

White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

One fist
Hammers through the mist
One fist
Steady on
One heart
Die hard from the start
One heart
Beats its song

Murder all
Murder one
Gimme murder
Second class to none

Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse

Till the end
Been living to win
Been living to win

Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you’ll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it’s only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought cause it’s only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within
Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

Plug into me I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I’ll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Accelerate, Utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan
Reinvent the earth inhabitant

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown 
Spit out the bone

The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine

Stop breathing
And dedicate to me
Stop dreaming
And terminate for me
All meaning
You dedicate to me
All feelings
You terminate for me

Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah
