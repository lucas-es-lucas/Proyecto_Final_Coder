Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
It ain't my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Can't fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
While you around?
So useless

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

No way but down
Why you're around
No fooling

It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
You ain't mine

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away

Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps

I don't want it

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me... till clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps

Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown,
King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown, King Nothing?


Nothing

You're just nothing
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
You're just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to never-never land

Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something

I'm sowing the seeds

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

It tears me and I bleed
And I bleed

Caught under wheels' roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheels' roll
The bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release

Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheels' roll
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again

He thinks the answer's cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
"I do believe"

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
"I do believe"
"I do believe"

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
"I do believe"

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
"I do believe"
"Yeah, I do believe"

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure

Precious cure

And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I'll keep it for myself

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done
The brightest flame burns quickest
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

When I'm branded, this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced, 
or straight ahead and know that you must blame?

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, 
one and the same are we

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I do your time, I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, 
one and the same are we

I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I am the thorn within

Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red... red, I'm afraid... 
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away"

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

I heard it
He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallows calls, son," I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
And they all pray,
"Blood stain, wash away"

He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
I heard it
He said,
"I lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my way"
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face"
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down

He said,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me

Stitch me together
Save me
