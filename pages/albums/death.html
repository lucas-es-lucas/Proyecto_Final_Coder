Like a siren in my head that always
Threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat 
Like a face 
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused 
Though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that 
I must awaken from each day
Like conviction 
A premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny...... I deny

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by 
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long 
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when 
I only need a drink
Like a poison
That I swallow
But I want the world to die

Like a release from prison 
That I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed 
To leave
From way back then
Like a general 
Without a mission 
Until the war will start again...... start again

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by 
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long 
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight 
Curse the day is long 
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life
That was just your life

Need... more and more
Tainted misery 
Bleed... battle scars
Chemical affinity
Reign... legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain... rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke... asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch... kill the light
Incinerate celebrity
Reaper... butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline... redefine
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Nevermind...
You've reached the end of the line

Time... Choke the clock
Steal another day
Die... Faithfully
Narcissistic fade away
Twisted... Jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker... Chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Nevermind...
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today 
We bid farewell... 
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Nevermind...
Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today 
Say goodbye 
Cause you've reached the end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line

Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred

Bleeding your soul in a hard luck story
Show your scars
Spilling your blood in the hot sun's glory

Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes
No, the son shine never comes

Push you cross that line,
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes

Love... is a four letter word,
And never spoken here
Love... is a four letter word,
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer,
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear 
The son will shine
This, I swear,
This, I swear,

Luck. Runs. Out.

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction feel it burn

Still life... incarnation
Still life... infamy

Hallucination 
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we...
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in, 
But your luck runs out

Luck. Runs. Out.

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life... immolation
Still life... infamy

Hallucination 
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we...
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck. Runs. Out.
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Then you crawl back in,
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck. Runs. Out.

You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
Your luck runs out

Sleep and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty they say,
Death, won't you let me stay?

Empty they say,
Death, hear me call your name,
Call your name...

...suicide 
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forever more

Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty they say,
Death, won't you let me stay?

Empty they say,
Death, hear me call your name, 
Call your name...

...suicide 
I've already died
You're just the funeral
I've been waiting for

...cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forever more

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down 
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, peace at last!

Empty they say,
Death, won't you let me stay?

Empty they say,
Death, hear me call your name, 
Call your name...

...suicide 
I've already died
You're just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

...cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forever more

Forever more,
Forever more
It's just the funeral 
I've been waiting for

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid,
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?  In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
Thick and suffocating
His sinking life, outside its hell
Inside, intoxicating

He's run aground Like his life, 
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship, 
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?  In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea, but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost, if I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, 
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost?  In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you, 
When it's me I can't forgive?

When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting on the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist
Cannot resist,
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate 
Patronize and complicate

So, what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist
Cannot resist,
The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seed of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all...
Inside you all

So, bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss,
You don't exist
Cannot resist,
The Judas kiss

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: annihilation
Desolate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, bones they all rattle 
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
