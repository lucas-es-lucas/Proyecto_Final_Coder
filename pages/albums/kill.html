No life 'til leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming 
It's right, well alright
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

We know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

With all out screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It's causing you sweet pain, oh sweet pain
When we start to rock 
We never want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

By the last breath the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Time 
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you've had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So gather 'round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I'm taking down, you know, whatever's in my way
Getting your kicks as you're shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, same song and dance

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
To join our sinful kind
There's a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now, my child, not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I'm stalking you as prey
Living your life as me, I am you, you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down, grab my hand, walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on

Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage 
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness 
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on stage the Marshall noise 
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
'Cause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we'll never stop
We'll never quit
'Cause we're Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
Fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees

No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we've done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack

Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose

Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse

With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here

The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near

No remorse

We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking but now you're giving

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away
'Cause you're the one we will find

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths

Searching

Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered, the law of the land
What will befall you?
The metallization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

We are as one, yes, we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
