Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red

One hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em, man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome

Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, head on, headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Lives way too fast

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

White-knuckle tight

Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire

On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere cheers of honor

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back

And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Dance, little tin goddess

Drift away
Fade away
Little tin goddess

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black
But the memory remains

To this faded prima donna

Dance, little tin goddess, dance

Feel those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's wanting through
Deep inside you know the seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite to take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
Come dance

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance

I feel you too
Feel those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
C'mon, c'mon now take the chance
That's right

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now but it's opened if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked skies
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through

No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

Come beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven, too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven, too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven, too

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Watch the puppets dancing
See the clowns fall down
Tie your tap shoes tightly
And wear them into town

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here, no, no more

Play the game so nicely
Check, it's your move now
We're standing in this jungle
With serpents I have found

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Have your heroes disappeared?

See you crawlin'
See you crawlin' in

So don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun, you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
No, there ain't no heroes here, no

Haven't I seen you here before?
No there ain't no heroes here

Don't go looking for snakes, you might find them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Hit dirt
Shake tree
Split sky
Part sea

Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule

Live, win
Dare, fail
Eat the dirt
And bite the nail

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby

Draw lead
Piss wine
Sink teeth
All mine

Stoke fire
Break neck
Suffer through this
Cheat on death

Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day
Come carpe diem, baby

Live, win
Dare, fail
Eat dirt
Bite the nail

Strip smile
Lose cool
Bleed the day
And break the rule

Hug the curve
Lose the time
Tear the map
And shoot the sign

Then make me miss you
Then make me miss you

So wash your face away with dirt
It don't feel good until it hurts
So take this world and shake it
Come squeeze and suck the day

Come make me miss you
Come carpe diem, baby
Come carpe diem, baby

Come clean, fess up
Tell all, spill gut
Off the veil, stand revealed
Show the cards, bring it on, break the seal

Ladies and gentlemen, step right up
And see the man who told the truth

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking on
the bad seed
On the bad seed
Choking

Let on, load off
Confess, cast off
At the mercy, the cat is out
Drop the disguise, spit it up, spit it out

And now, what you've all been waiting for
I give you "He Who Suffers the Truth"

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Now you're choking on the bad seed
Choking on the bad seed

Off the veil, stand revealed
Bring it on, break the seal
At the mercy, cat is out
Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it out now

At the mercy

Swing the noose again
Pierce the apple skin
You bit more than you need
Choking on the seed

Swing the noose again

You bit more than you need

Spit it up, spit it out
Spit it out now

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world

Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you're here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach)
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air)
Toy horses start the charge
(All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes)
Robot chessmen standing guard
(Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender)

All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war

So close your little eyes

There's a black cloud overhead
That's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth, I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Mom! Look, it's me

And he wants to be called "Father" now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me
Spell only me
I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

Look up to me,
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, it's me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look, it's me, what no one wants to see

Now see the black cloud up ahead
That's me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry

Look, it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, it's me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain

I fall 'cause I've let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And you won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

And I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So wicked and worn

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due

Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

Suppose I say "I'm never satisfied"
Suppose I say "You cut some root to make the tree survive"

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to death

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?

Suppose I say "The vultures smile at me"
Suppose I say "I've sent them down and they plan to pick you clean"

And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone, gone
Gone again

I hunger
I hunger
I eat

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever?
Whatever happened to sweat?

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me

I hunger

Born into attitude

Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there

Born into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throwing all your bullets in the fire

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Mirror, mirror, upon thy wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three Xs for the stone
To break this curse a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith, which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

No more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
